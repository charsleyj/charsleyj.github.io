									<h3 class="major">Introduction</h3>
									<p>
										First coursework for the final year of my degree.
										This is a simple C++ program that can generate 15-tile style puzzles (writing them to a file),
										and calculate the number of rows and columns which can appear in order
										(increment by 1 as you go right/down) of all the reachable states of the puzzle.
										This is then written to a file.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">What I Learnt</h3>
									<p>
										 This was the first time I had properly tackled a combinatory puzzle,
										 thinking about how best go through each possible combination of tiles,
										 counting rows/columns which were continuous.
										 Also, although I had used C++ earlier in my degree,
										 this module was a useful refresher of the language.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Implementation</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>The program is controlled by a main file
											which handles menus and instantiation of other classes.</li>
										<li>A factory class is used to create/load from file Configuration classes
											which store the state of a particular puzzle.</li>
										<li>The configuration class was extended to allow puzzles
											of any rectangular size and tiles between 1-1,000,000.</li>
										<li>A solver class takes in a series of configuration objects to solve.
											The initial idea was to walk through each of the possible states,
											counting the number of continuous rows/columns,
											but is was felt this would be too slow for the larger puzzle sizes,
											so an equation was used instead.</li>
										<li>The solver then stores the solutions in a struct
											to be printed to screen or written to a file.</li>
									</ul>


									<h3 class="major">Possible Improvements</h3>
									<ul>
										<li> The problem simply concerned 2d puzzles.
											As such, further work could be done to storing and solving puzzles of arbitrary dimensions.</li>
									</ul>
