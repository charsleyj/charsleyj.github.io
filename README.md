# Hi, I'm Jamie. This is my Portfolio

I'm a 23 year old student, studying an MComp in Computer Science at Newcastle University. I'm currently focusing on game engineering for my final year, however, I've gained a broad range of experience within computer science throughout my degree. As such, I also have a keen interest in programming language design and software development in general.



Outside of my degree, I work on several personal projects both within and outside programming. I also enjoy playing tabletop games, tennis and the trumpet.



The website currently contains some of the work I did at university, however, I am in the process of moving some of my personal projects. These include games, language interpreters, tools and anything else I find interesting.
