									<h3 class="major">Introduction</h3>
									<p>
										This was the second piece of coursework for the final year of my degree.
										The aim for the coursework was to use C++ and OpenGL to render a landscape
										that changed over time. This was done using Newcastle University’s graphics framework,
										NCLGL, which was built upon throughout the module.
									</p>
									<p>
										For the coursework, I created a landscape that rose out of the water over time.
										The landscape also featured several trees, lanterns,
										a UFO and some models provided by the university.

									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Implementation</h3>
									<p>
										The scene was controlled using a scene graph.
										Each node of the tree could contain a mesh to render,
										a transform relative to the node’s parent, and
										a shader if the child node needed to be rendered differently.
									</p>
									<p>
										The terrain was generated using an index buffer,
										and then reading a heightmap file to raise the vertices to the correct height.
										Depending on the vertex height, the terrain was textured using one of two textures
										(grass texture for lower terrain, and rock for higher) and given one of two bump maps,
										allowing extra detail without having to provide extra vertices.
										When texturing the terrain, Triplanar Texturing was used to prevent textures
										from stretching in steep areas of the terrain.
										To create the rising effect, the heightmap shader was passed a factor between 0 and 1.
										This determined how much the heightmap had risen at each vertex.
										This was also used by an objects on the heightmap, so that their positions could be updated.
									</p>

									<p>
										The water was also created using an index buffer. However, rather than using a heightmap,
										a rolling sine wave was used to create an illusion of waves.
										Like the terrain, the water was given a texture and a bump map, however,
										cube mapping was also used to give reflections of the distant mountains.
										This is a similar technique to how the skybox was created, however,
										different methods were used to calculate the direction vector used to sample the cube map.
									</p>
									<p>
										Lighting was achieved using the Phong Lighting Model, providing calculations for ambient,
										diffuse and specular lighting. The main light is a purely directional light, without an origin.
										Each of the lanterns create a point light centred at their origin.
										Lastly, the UFO circling the landscape produces a spotlight which will only light
										terrain within a given angle. Shadow mapping was then used to form the shadows
										of the objects onto the terrain. This is done dynamically, allowing the shadows to
										update when objects move.
									</p>

									<p>
										Several post processing effects were then added.
										This was done by renderering the scene to a texture bound to a framebuffer.
										This could then sampled in post processing steps before being rendered
										to the screen using a quad.
									</p>
										Post processing effects included:
										<ul>
											<li>A general gaussian blur using ping pong processing.</li>
											<li>A modified version to create a depth of field effect by sampling the depth buffer.</li>
											<li>2 versions of Sobel Edge Detection
												(a traditional black and white version, and a coloured version).</li>
											<li>A simple Gameboy filter by setting the pixel to one of 4 colours
												based on the pixels ‘intensity’.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<p>
										A split screen was also added, with each sub-screen allowing its own post processing effect.
										This was done by rendering the scene twice (once from each camera’s perspective)
										and applying them as textures to quads at one of two positions on the screen.
