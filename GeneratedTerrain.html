									<h3 class="major">Introduction</h3>
									<p>
										The aim of this project was to create an infinite scrolling terrain
										using procedural generation. I researched various uses and algorithms for
										procedural generation, created a system for infinite scrolling
										terrain using a couple of these algorithms, and compared them on performance and
										graphical detail.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">What I Learnt</h3>
									<p>
										As part of the research, I gained a far greater insight into procedural generation
										than I had before, including the different type and uses of procedural generation,
										as well as several algorithms. However, the software engineering aspect of the project
										taught me the importance of good project management, planning the project in advance,
										with plenty of room for problems to occur, and making sure that I kept to the plan,
										updating it where necessary.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Implementation</h3>
									<h4>Scrolling Terrain</h4>
									<p>
										To achieve the infinite scrolling effect, I spilt the world into square chunks,
										organised into a scene graph. The renderer would then store a 5x5 grid
										of these chunks surrounding the player. When the player moved into a new chunk,
										rather than unloading and reloading in new chunks, I moved chunks now outside the
										5x5 grid into a new position and updated their vertex positions.
									</p>
									<h4>Procedural Generation</h4>
									<p>
										I compared two different procedural generation techniques: Perlin Noise and Value Noise.
										I ran each of them at 1, 2, and 3 octaves (the more octaves used,
										the greater the detail but the slower the generation).
										I then compared how detailed the output was as well as the frame time
										it took to generate the results. I found that for the same number of octaves,
										Perlin Noise took longer but produced better results than Value Noise, which was expected.
										However, after several octaves, Value Noise could be ran with more octaves
										quicker than Perlin Noise, producing more detailed terrain. Nevertheless,
										it is still generally considered that Perlin Noise would produce more natural looking terrain,
										regardless of the performance or level of detail.
									</p>


									<h3 class="major">Possible Improvements</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>During the project, the infinite scrolling was left toward the end of the project,
											and suffered from slow down, with little time for me to see what was causing it.
											As I now have far more experience with C++ and OpenGL than when I completed the project,
											the first improvement I would make would be to reduce the slowdown of the effect.
											Possible solutions may to improve the memory management of the meshes on the GPU,
											or using shaders to either help with, or to control the generation of the terrain. </li>
										<li>the original project mostly only focused on two PCG algorithms,
											both of which relied on noise. Were I to continue this project,
											I would look at far more PCG algorithms, including several which do not rely
											on noise as much, such as the diamond square algorithm.</li>
										<li>The program constructed the terrain using a 2D heightmap. It would be interesting
											to see what effect would happen if the PCG techniques were applied to higher dimensions,
											such as 3D or 4D space.</li>
										<li>Lastly, the program focused purely of the generation of the base terrain shape,
											however, I would also like to look at adding additional features, such as biomes,
											vegetation or settlements and see how each of the algorithms reacted with each other.</li>
