						<h3 class="major">Introduction</h3>
						<p>
							The aim of this project was to create an infinite scrolling terrain
							using procedural generation. I researched various uses and algorithms for
							procedural generation, created a system for infinite scrolling
							terrain using a couple of these algorithms, and compared them on performance and
							graphical detail.
						</p>

						<h3 class="major">What I Learnt</h3>
						<p>
							As part of the research, I gained a far greater insight into procedural generation
							than I had before, including the different type and uses of procedural generation,
							as well as several algorithms. The software engineering element also
							taught me the importance of good project management, planning the project
							with plenty of room for problems to occur, and making sure that I kept to the plan,
							updating it where necessary.
						</p>

						<h3 class="major">Implementation</h3>

						<h4>Scrolling Terrain (Scene Graph)</h4>
						<p>
							To achieve infinite scrolling, I spilt the world into square chunks,
							organised in a scene graph. The renderer stored a 5x5 grid
							of these chunks around the player. When the player moved into a new chunk,
							rather than unloading and reloading in new chunks, chuncks were moved
							into a new position.
						</p>

						<h4>Procedural Generation</h4>
						<p>
							Two different procedural generation techniques were compared: Perlin Noise and Value Noise.
							I ran each of them at 1, 2, and 3 octaves (the more octaves used,
							the greater the detail but the slower the generation).
							I then compared the generation time and how detailed the output was.
							For the same number of octaves, Perlin Noise took longer but produced better results
							than Value Noise. However, after several octaves, Value Noise could be ran with more octaves
							quicker than Perlin Noise, producing more detailed terrain. Though,
							it's still generally considered that Perlin Noise produces more natural looking terrain,
							regardless of performance or level of detail.
						</p>

						<h3 class="major">Possible Improvements</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>The infinite scrolling was left toward the end of the project,
								and suffered from slow down, with little time to see what was causing it.
								As I now have far more experience with C++ and OpenGL, I would reduce the slowdown of the effect.
								Possible solutions may be to improve the memory management of the meshes on the GPU,
								or using shaders to help with/control the generation of the terrain. </li>
							<li>the original project mostly only focused on two PCG algorithms,
								both of which relied on noise. Were I to continue this project,
								I would look at far more PCG algorithms, including several which do not rely
								on noise as much, such as the diamond square algorithm.</li>
							<li>The program constructed the terrain using a 2D heightmap. It would be interesting
								to see what effect would happen if the PCG techniques were applied to higher dimensions,
								such as 3D or 4D space.</li>
							<li>The program focused purely of the generation of the base terrain shape,
								however, I would also like to look at adding additional features, such as biomes,
								vegetation or settlements and see how each of the algorithms reacted with each other.</li>
