									<h3 class="major">Introduction</h3>
									<p>
										This was the team project for the final year of my degree. As part of a team of 8,
										the aim of the project was to use C++ to create a cross-platform game for Windows and PS4.
										The game needed to be a 3D golf game where the player was able to change the fundamental
										rules of the game as they played, inspired by "What the Golf" and "Baba is You".
									</p>
									<p>
										In addition to the core golf mechanics, we created 3 main mechanics:
										Adjustable gravity, possessable objects, and adjustable time.
										Unfortunately, we were unable to finish the project
										as it was cut short due to the COVID-19 lockdown.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">What I Learnt</h3>
									<p>
										As the largest project I have worked on to date, this gave me a huge insight
										into how large projects are structured and the complexities involved when working on them.
										This was especially true due to the cross-platform nature of the game,
										as I have not worked on any other cross-platform project before.
										Lastly, working on a team project the large has re-enforced the importance
										of version control software throughout the project, such as GitHub,
										due to different people working on different parts of the program at any one time.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Implementation</h3>
									<p>
										There were two main areas that I was responsible for:
										The graphics framework and the Level loading.
									</p>
									<h4>Graphics</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>I combined the graphics frameworks
											for the previous two modules: NCLGL from Advanced Graphics for Games,
											and OpenGL Rendering from Game Technologies.
											This was because each of the frameworks contained aspects
											which we wanted to include.</li>
										<li>I added Cube Mapping (primarily for the skybox),
											post processing effects, and extended the lighting/shadow mapping
											of the framework. Sadly I was unable to add some of these features
											to the PS4 build due to the project being cut short.</li>
									</ul>
									<h4>Level Loading</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>A CSV file format was used for storing the levels.</li>
										<li>These were generated from a Unity script which
											would take a constructed scene and output it into a file.</li>
										<li>This could then be read into a buffered level
											within the game itself.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3 class="major">Possible Improvements</h3>
									<ul>
										<li> The obvious improvement would have been to complete the game,
											even if this was only the Windows side. </li>
										<li> If we were to do the project again, we would not have branched
											out as much as we did, as well as focusing more on the PS4 side earlier on.</li>
									</ul>
