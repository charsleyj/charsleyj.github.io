									<h3 class="major">Introduction</h3>
									<p>
										This was the third piece of coursework for the final year of my degree.
										The aim for the coursework was to use C++ to create a game in which the player
										controlled an angry goose, picking up apples and taking them back to an island,
										avoiding enemies along the way.
									</p>
									<p>
										For the coursework, we were given a very basic framework and had to add physics,
										collision detection/resolution, state machines, pathfinding and networking between
										multiple instances of the game.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Implementation</h3>

									<h4>Physics</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Simple Newtonian physics was used in the game,
											allowing objects to be moved by applying forces on them.
											This can result in both linear and angular motion, by applying
											Semi-Implicit Euler Integration.</li>
									</ul>

									<h4>Collision Detection</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Objects in the game are represented by one of three collision volumes:
											Sphere, AABB, or OBB. The physics system can detect collisions between
											Sphere/Sphere, Sphere/AABB, AABB/AABB, or Sphere/OBB.</li>
										<li>Each collision volume is given a Unity-style Collision Layer. These will
											only collide with volumes on other specified layers, allowing some objects
											to not collide with each other. These are used by the goose and island in the game,
											only letting them pick up and score particular items.</li>
										<li>The collision detection is accelerated using a broad phase
											in the form of Quad Trees, allowing the world to be split up and reducing
											the number of collision pairs being tested.</li>
									</ul>

									<h4>Collision Resolution</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Collisions are resolved using projection, adjusting the object positions
											to return them to a valid state.</li>
										<li> Objects are then given an impulse, adjusting their linear and angular
											velocity to account for the collision.</li>
										<li>Finally, some collision volumes can be marked are Trigger Volumes.
											These will detect collisions, but will skip the resolution phase,
											allowing objects to detect certain collisions without responding to them.
											This is used in the game by the water to create a bobbing effect,
											and by the goose home, which surrounds the island and will score items placed inside.</li>
									</ul>

									<h4>Artifical Intelligence</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Finite State machines are used by enemies in the game, which will chase
											the goose if it walks close by with an item.</li>
										<li>A* pathfinding is then used when chasing the goose.</li>
									</ul>

									<h4>Networking</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>The game also has a shared high-score table, which is stored
											by a server machine. After a player’s game ends, their score
											will be added to the table, and the table is then sent to the
											player’s game to display.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3 class="major">What I Learnt</h3>
									<p>
										Although I had done some game physics and AI in the past, it was purely 2d.
										This coursework built upon this knowledge, moving it into 3d games,
										and explored topics not covered in the previous module, such as OBB colliders and constraints.
										It also gave me an introduction to networking within games, which I had not covered before.
									</p>


									<h3 class="major">Possible Improvements</h3>
									<ul>
										<li> I would improve the quality of some of the code.
											As the coursework had a scrict deadline, there was little time to improve code
											after it was made functional, especially towards the end of coursework period.</li>
										<li> There were several features I would have liked to add if I had more time.
											The largest of these would be a more expansive networked mode.
											For example, the networking was limited to a shared highscore table,
											however, I would like to implement a full multi-player version
											of the game.</li>
										<li> I woud like to improve the performance of the game.
											A possible solution would be to amend the pathfinding so that
											agents only update the path every few frames.
											Alternatively, additional collision acceleration such as static and dynamic objects
											could be implemented.</li>
										<li> Lastly, the graphical capabilities of the Game Tech framework were very limited,
											with the focus being on other aspects of the game. I would like to try and improve the
											graphics of the game, bringing in aspects of the graphics coursework which were left
											out of the framework.</li>
